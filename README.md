# FUTURE_ML_01

 This project analyzes the Superstore sales dataset to uncover monthly sales trends using Python and machine learning. A Linear Regression model is trained to predict future sales, and the results are visualized through charts showing historical trends and actual vs. predicted sales. The model also forecasts sales for the next 3 months beyond the dataset.
